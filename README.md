Build is pretty simple for now, but hopefully will be updated.


# Branches

Please make your pull requests against `Develop`. This branch pushes to dev for the final stages of testing.
You can request to join the HipChat and Slack channels for testing the integration in real time.

Once testing is passed, the feature will appear in Master which gets pushed to production. The master integration can be
used by anyone.
